- `cargo test test_delta_gossip_with_vector_clocks` - Test delta gossip with vector clocks

## Architecture Overview

This is a **distributed gossip protocol library** for actor registry management using vector clocks for causal consistency. The system implements a peer-to-peer gossip protocol where nodes share information about actor locations across a distributed network.

### Core Components

**Main Library (`src/lib.rs`)**
- Defines core types: `NodeId`, `VectorClock`, `ActorLocation`, `GossipConfig`, `GossipError`
- Implements vector clock logic for causal ordering and conflict resolution
- Provides configuration structures for gossip behavior

**GossipRegistry (`src/registry.rs`)**
- Core registry implementation with separated actor and gossip state locks
- Handles actor registration/unregistration with vector clock increments
- Implements delta-based gossip with full-sync fallback
- Provides vector clock garbage collection and conflict resolution
- Uses connection pooling for efficient peer communication

**GossipRegistryHandle (`src/handle.rs`)**
- Main API interface for the gossip registry
- Manages server lifecycle (TCP listener, gossip timer, bootstrap)
- Handles incoming connections and message processing
- Implements non-blocking gossip rounds with concurrent task execution

**ConnectionPool (`src/connection_pool.rs`)**
- Persistent TCP connections with bidirectional communication
- Manages connection lifecycle with immediate disconnection detection
- Handles all message types on all connections (no dedicated request/response channels)
- Implements automatic reconnection with configurable retry intervals

### Key Design Patterns

**Vector Clock-Based Conflict Resolution**
- Each node maintains a vector clock for causal ordering
- Actor updates include vector clocks for conflict resolution
- Concurrent updates resolved using node ID as tiebreaker

**Delta Gossip with Full-Sync Fallback**
- Efficient delta-based gossip for incremental updates
- Automatic fallback to full sync when delta history insufficient
- Small clusters (≤5 nodes) use full sync for better propagation

**Separated Lock Architecture**
- Actor state uses RwLock for read-heavy operations (lookups)
- Gossip state uses Mutex for coordination and peer management
- Minimizes lock contention during gossip rounds

**Persistent Bidirectional Connections**
- Each node maintains persistent TCP connections to all peers
- All connections are bidirectional - can send and receive any message type
- Immediate EOF detection (milliseconds) when peer disconnects
- Automatic reconnection attempts every 5 seconds for failed peers

### Message Types
- `DeltaGossip` - Incremental changes since last sequence
- `FullSync` - Complete actor state synchronization
- `FullSyncRequest` - Request for full state from peer
- Response variants for two-way communication

### Message Types
- `PeerHealthQuery` - Query other nodes about a peer's health status
- `PeerHealthReport` - Report on a peer's health from another node's perspective

### Configuration
The `GossipConfig` struct controls:
- Gossip intervals and peer selection
- Connection timeouts and message limits
- Vector clock garbage collection frequency
- Delta history retention and full sync intervals
- `peer_retry_interval` - How often to retry failed connections (default: 5 seconds)
- `dead_peer_timeout` - How long before removing disconnected peers (default: 15 minutes)

## Connection Failure and Recovery Flow

### Immediate Disconnection Detection
When a peer disconnects or crashes, the system detects it immediately through EOF (End-of-File) detection:

1. **EOF Detection**: The read task on the TCP connection receives `Ok(0)` bytes, indicating the peer has closed their write side
2. **Connection Marked Failed**: The connection is immediately marked as disconnected in the connection pool
3. **Peer State Updated**: The peer's failure count is set to max failures, preventing normal gossip
4. **Actors Remain Available**: Importantly, actors registered by the failed peer are NOT removed - they remain queryable

### Consensus Process (Optional)
After detecting a local disconnection, the node may query other peers to understand if the failure is global:

1. **100ms Delay**: Wait briefly to avoid race conditions where other nodes haven't detected the failure yet
2. **Query Peers**: Send `PeerHealthQuery` messages to all healthy peers asking about the failed peer
3. **Collect Reports**: Gather `PeerHealthReport` responses from other nodes
4. **Consensus Decision**: If majority agrees the peer is dead, it's marked as globally failed
5. **No Actor Removal**: Even with consensus, actors are kept available for potential reconnection

### Automatic Reconnection
Failed peers are automatically retried:

1. **Retry Timer**: Every 5 seconds (configurable via `peer_retry_interval`), failed peers are included in gossip rounds
2. **Connection Attempt**: The system attempts to establish a new TCP connection to the failed peer
3. **Two-Way Recovery**: Recovery can happen in two ways:
   - **Outgoing Success**: Our retry connects to the recovered peer, and we receive messages from them
   - **Incoming Connection**: The recovered peer connects to us

### Failure Reset Conditions
A peer's failure state is only reset when we have proof they're truly back online:

1. **Incoming Connection**: When we accept a new connection and identify it's from a previously failed peer
2. **Message Receipt**: When we receive any gossip message (Delta or FullSync) from a previously failed peer
3. **NOT on Connection Success**: Simply establishing a TCP connection is not enough - we need actual communication

### Dead Peer Actor Cleanup
After extended disconnection periods, resources are cleaned up while maintaining connectivity:

1. **15-Minute Timeout**: By default, after 15 minutes of disconnection, actors from the peer are removed
2. **Peer Retained**: The peer itself is NEVER removed - ensuring we can always reconnect
3. **Memory Cleanup**: Only the actors are removed to free memory, not the peer entry
4. **Automatic Recovery**: When the peer reconnects, it will re-register its actors through normal gossip

### Example Scenario

```
Time 0s: Node A and B are connected, gossiping normally
Time 10s: Node A crashes
Time 10.003s: Node B detects EOF, marks A as failed (but keeps A's actors)
Time 10.103s: Node B queries other nodes about A's health (if any exist)
Time 15s: Node B attempts reconnection to A (fails)
Time 20s: Node B attempts reconnection to A (fails)
Time 25s: Node A restarts with same address
Time 25s: Node B attempts reconnection to A (succeeds, TCP established)
Time 25.1s: Node A sends FullSync message to B
Time 25.1s: Node B receives message, resets A's failure count
Time 25.1s: Normal gossip resumes between A and B
```

### Key Properties

1. **Fast Detection**: Disconnections detected in milliseconds, not through timeouts
2. **High Availability**: Actors remain queryable even when their registering node is down
3. **Automatic Recovery**: No manual intervention needed when nodes come back online
4. **No Split-Brain**: Clear ownership of actors through vector clocks prevents conflicts
5. **Efficient Retries**: Failed nodes checked every 5 seconds, not on every gossip round
